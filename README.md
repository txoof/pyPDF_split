# pyPDF_split
Split PDFs with multiple student records into individual PDFs.

pyPDF_split searches a PDF for the string `StudentID:NNNNNNN` and splits the PDF into individual PDFs in a sub-folder with the StudentID embedded in the new file name.

If the pyPDF program is unavialble or does not work, see these [backup instructions](https://github.com/txoof/pyPDF_split/blob/master/Backup_Plan.md#backup-plan-for-pypdfsplit)


pyPDF_split can handle student IDs in the following formats:

* `StudentID:123456`; `StudentId:123456`; `STUDENTID:123456`; `studentid:123456` 
    - upper/lower case is ignored in all cases
* `Student ID:123456`; `Student ID: 123456`

pyPDF_split pairs nicely with the [insertFiles](https://github.com/txoof/insertFiles) and [create_folders](https://github.com/txoof/portfolioCreator) scripts.

Build this script in a pyenv/pipenv with TK built in.
1. See [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/txoof/675e72d43f1bfbade04fdcec99ff4085) for complete instructions for setting up a working pyenv with TK, pipenv and Jupyter
2. Set up a Python 3+ jupyter kernel for further editing from within this repo directory:
```
$ pipenv --3 install ipykernel
$ projectName=$(basename `pipenv --venv`)
$ pipenv run python -m ipykernel install --user --name="${projectName}"
```
3. Make any edits needed and then rebuild the program with:
```
$ ./build.sh
```
